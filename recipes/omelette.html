    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The traditional French omelette consists of just eggs and butter with no other filling. It takes some practice to get down, since getting the right texture is more dependant on technique than ingredients.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large fesh eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cold water</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne or white pepper, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cooking Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
       <li>Whisk eggs, water, and salt together in mixing bowl, for 1-2 minutes. Egg whites should be completely blended in.</li> 
       <li>Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in 9-10 inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
       <li>As butter melts, before it sizzles, pour in whisked eggs. Stir in cicular pattern with heat-proof spatula.</li>
       <li>While stirring, lift and scramble eggs. Shake the pan to level out mixture. Continue until shaking pan no longer levels mixture.</li>
       <li>Reduce heat to low. Use spatula to smooth surface of mixture.</li>
       <li>When surface of mixture is wet but no longer runny, remove pan from heat.</li>
       <li>Use spatula to begin rolling omellete from handle side of pan until small flap of egg remains.</li>
       <li>Fold final flap of egg over the top of cylinder, keeping seam-side up.</li>
       <li>Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter to pan. Gently push melting butter under omelette.</li>
